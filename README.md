# Code for "Examining Supervised Machine Learning Methods for Integer Link Weight Prediction Using Node Metadata"

With the goal of understanding if the information contained in node metadata can help in the task of link weight prediction, we investigate whether incorporating it as a similarity feature (referred to as metadata similarity) between end nodes of a link improves the prediction accuracy of common supervised machine learning methods, such as:

- Poisson regression
- Poisson mixture models
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Neural Networks
